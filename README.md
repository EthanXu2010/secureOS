# secureOS
an extra item for the menu bar in mac to change your ipv4 and ipv6(not recommended). This also has a disposable email function, glitchy, but functional. I am most proud of the ad block, it scored a 97% on ad block test, while your average web store ad block scored 68%

-JUST ENTER-
$ python3 app.py
-THERE SHOULD BE A SECUREOS TEXT THAT APPEARED ON THE MENU BAR-
-CLICK IT FOR ALL THE FUNCTIONS-

IMPORTANT: SOME WEBSITES WILL BE UNACCESSABLE, IF THAT IS HAPPENING JUST PRESS THE RESET NEWTWORK BUTTON
YOU ALSO NEED TO ENTER YOUR DEVICE PASSWORD TO ACTIVATE ALL THE SUDO COMMANDS USED IN THE SCRIPT
